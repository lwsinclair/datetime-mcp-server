        "/path/to/your/datetime-mcp-server/main.py"
      ]

## ❓ FAQ

<details><summary>My Claude Desktop is not detecting the server</summary>

- Ensure you have the latest version of Claude Desktop.
- Restart Claude Desktop by force quitting the app and reopening it.
- Make sure your path is correct in the configuration file.
- Use the absolute path to your `uv` installation, e.g., `/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv` in the command section of the configuration file. It should look like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Datetime": {
      "command": "/Users/[Your Home Directory]/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--with",
        "mcp[cli]",
        "mcp",
        "run",
        "/path/to/your/datetime-mcp-server/main.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

<details><summary>I've asked Claude what the time is but it's not using the MCP server</summary>

- LLMs like Claude may not always use the MCP server for every request. If it doesn't use the server, try asking again or rephrasing your question specifically asking it to use the MCP Server.
